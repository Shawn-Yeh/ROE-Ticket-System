## Overview of the Solution

Here's a breakdown of how the script will work:

1. Access the Google Sheet: The script will first access your Google Sheet and retrieve the data.
Loop Through Rows: It will then loop through each row in the sheet, treating each row as a separate data source.
2. Populate the Google Slide Template: For each row, the script will create a copy of your Google Doc template and populate it with the data from that row, replacing the variables with the corresponding values.
3. Generate PDFs: The script will then convert each populated Google Doc into a PDF file.
4. Name PDFs: Each PDF will be named according to your specified format.
5. Save PDFs to Google Drive: Finally, the script will save all the generated PDFs to your designated Google Drive folder.
